<h2> Experience </h2>

<strong> Walmart Cashier: </strong> 
Working at Walmart during the summer following the COVID-19 global pandameic taught me just how childish adults can be. I had to put up with some of the worst types of people that Walmart can produce, which didn't strengthen my character as one would expect, but rather taught me how to be more patient with these grown up children: treat them like toddlers. The job itself was decent. I was thrown to the sharks with barely any prior training, so I would sweat when someone came up with strange fruits and vegetables (each produce has its own number associted, of which I had none memorized). The managers were quite nice, and the other employees were all around my age. Not a terrible first job, and what better way to end it than a lay-off.

<strong> Amazon Warehouse Associate: </strong> 
Amazon is very much a love hate relationship for me. On one hand, it's pretty easy money and you get paid weekly. On the other, it is probably the closest one could get to modern day slavery. The amount of mental anguish and physical labor brought on by that job makes me never want to step back into their warehouse again. 5/10 would work there again for quick and easy money. They hire ANYONE. Once I was fed up with breaking my back moving 20-40 lbs. boxes for 10 hours straight, I applied to get on the forklift as soon as I could. If there's one thing Amazon excels at, it would be having terrible, unorganized management. My training for using a heavy piece of machinery that is very capable of causing lots of damage to myself and others was one shift long, and about maybe an hour or two actually driving. I got pretty good at it, to where having one month experience put me above most other drivers.

<strong> Amazing Student: </strong> 
I kind of surprised myself with how well I did and hopefully will continue to do for my last year of college. I somehow have a higher GPA than I did in high school, so I think it's okay to give myself some props. 3.96 ain't too shabby, it's too bad employers couldn't care less about it. It really only happened because I don't want to lose my yearly $10,000 scholarship. Higher education would become impossible to afford without loans. Which is another thing I want to bring up: the absolutely ludicrous price for that fancy piece of paper. Sure a degree CAN get you far, but just how useful will it be landing a job? When so many others also have one? I guess I will find out soon. I believe in myself, but not so much in modern day American capitalism. Kind of just waiting for an economic collapse at this point.
